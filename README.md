#### A somewhat balanced magic/tech/create focused modpack.

# Overview
## Singleplayer Setup:
### To make the installation process easier, I recommend using cubeLauncher: https://github.com/o7q/cubeLauncher
After downloading the modpack from this repository, extract the archive and drop & drag the contents onto the cubeLauncher window. \
<br>

## Multiplayer Setup:
After downloading the modpack from this repository, inside the ".cube" folder run the forge .jar executable installer. \
Select install server and choose an empty directory. \
Drag the mods and config folders into the server directory. \
There are two client-only mods that cannot be ran on a server.

Ensure that both of these mods are removed from the server mods folder before starting: \
~ 3dskinlayers-forge-1.4.6-mc1.18.2.jar \
~ NekosEnchantedBooks-1.18.2-1.7.0.jar \
(If you do not remove these mods it will result in a crash.)
